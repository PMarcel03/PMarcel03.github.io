## ✨ Core Technology Skills

This site is a showcase of my proficiency in **foundational web technologies**:

  * **HTML5:** Semantic structuring and accessible document markup.
  * **CSS3:** Responsive layouts, modern styling techniques (Flexbox & Grid), and custom animations.
  * **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Minor enhancements for UI functionality (e.g., handling menu toggles, simple interactions).
